I designed the puzzle game as mario puzzle game. 
A splash screen is displayed after you start the game. 
A dialog box appears to write the player's name.
After that, Number box appears. Player can enter the number of moves they want.

As soon as the player enters number of moves, game board is constructed.
The game board consists of three main areas:
1. Puzzle Area: 
    - First area on the left side has the puzzle pieces which are scrambled.
    - It contains one blank image which helps player to move the puzzles.
2. Player Name:
    - On the right side, name of the player is displayed.
3. Button Area:
    - This area is present at the bottom of the game board.
    - It has 3 buttons, quit, reset and load.
    - When the player clicks on the quit button, the game ends. 
    - Moves selected by the player are displayed on the bottom left side.
